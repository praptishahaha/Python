This is my first repository. I am getting started with python foundations. Starting from basics, and will go till advance!

<h1> First Python Task </h1>
# Simple Python Calculator

This project provides a basic command-line calculator written in Python. The calculator performs the following arithmetic operations between two numbers provided by the user:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with division-by-zero handling)

## How It Works

1. The program prompts you to enter two numbers.
2. It then calculates and displays the results for addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
3. For division, it checks if the second number is zero to avoid dividing by zero. If it's zero, it displays "Division : Invalid!".

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Run the calculator script:

```bash
python Calc.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to enter the two numbers.

## Example Output

```
Enter the 1st number: 5
Enter the 2nd number: 0
Addition : 5.0
Subtraction : 5.0
Multiplication : 0.0
Division : Invalid!
```
